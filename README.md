 Find what happens to the weight of dropped category in categorical variable

Interpretation:
The dropped category is Blue (alphabetically first by default).

The model learns:

Price(Blue) = 14.5 (intercept)

Price(Green) = 14.5 - 1.5 = 13.0

Price(Red) = 14.5 - 3.0 = 11.5

So, Blue’s weight is the intercept (β₀) — the base level.
